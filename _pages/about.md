I am a Computer Science graduate from [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/) in Pakistan, where I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (September 2021 – June 2025).

My research interests center on **healthcare informatics**, with a particular focus on applying **AI/ML** and **LLM systems** to clinical applications. I have worked on multiple research projects involving large language models for mental health assessment, multimodal prediction of anxiety and depression, clinical data analysis, and healthcare AI systems.

Currently, I am the Lead Developer at **SensAI**, an AI powered medical scribing platform that converts multilingual doctor–patient conversations into structured clinical notes, ICD-10 codes, and order sets, reducing documentation burden for physicians in Pakistan and the United States. This work directly addresses critical challenges in **healthcare informatics** by improving clinical workflow efficiency and documentation accuracy.

I am passionate about leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve real world problems in **healthcare informatics**, including clinical decision support systems, medical natural language processing, and the design of AI powered tools that enhance patient care and clinical workflows.
